Abstract. The widespread sharing of visual data online has created
challenges in querying and extracting relevant information efficiently.
This led to the establishment of the AI Challenge 2024, which aims to
develop systems capable of processing queries and accurately returning
event images from a large dataset of multi-genre videos. Our team ad-
dressed this by creating an interactive system leveraging models such as
CLIP, GPT-4o, PaddleOCR, and Whisper to generate precise embed-
dings and enable efficient data retrieval from diverse visual formats. The
system is supported by an GUI with features such as semantic search,
OCR-based and voice-based queries, AI-generated image queries, query
enhancement, and advanced video preprocessing. Through this approach,
our system reduced the unimportant data by 21% and achieved an ac-
curacy of 81.54% for the correct answers among the top 10 responses
3. This result showcases the system's potential for improving query re-
sponse accuracy and efficiency in large-scale visual data preprocessing.

Introduction
Images and videos are used to record activities in daily life, from personal mo-
ments to significant events. These images and videos can be stored on social
media platforms, video sharing services, and news applications, resulting in a
massive and diverse dataset in terms of size, genre, and subject matter. Due to
this richness, retrieving and searching for precise images presents a significant
challenge. For example, people desire to find specific images based on memorized
descriptions or keywords, not only from their photos but also from their videos.

This issue is the central focus of the 2024 Vietnam AI Challenge4 whose format
is similar to the Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC)5 and Video Browser Showdown
(VBS)6. The challenge provides a data set that contains Vietnamese videos in
various genres and topics, with several tasks that require the output of a specific
frame (image) indexed from the videos in the data set based on given inputs
(e.g., text query). The goal of such tasks focuses on two factors: accuracy and
speed, which are the objectives that our tool paper aims to address.
This paper provides a tool that assists humans in solving tasks in the com-
petition, as well as using several approaches to retrieve information. To do that,
our work contains a two-stage system: Data Preprocessing and Retrieval
Processing. In the first stage, videos from the input dataset are extracted into
frames (images) and meta data (e.g., name entities), which become a database
used for the Retrieval Processing stage. The latter stage is divided into two
main activities: listing image candidates and confirming such images. For the
first activity, the tool allows users to input queries in natural language format
such as texts, voices, or images, and the system returns relevant frame candi-
dates (from the database) ranked by semantic similarity and context. The latter
activity aims to confirm such candidates based on further re-ranking algorithms
and human efforts. Note, for the competition, our team constructed the query
and configured our tool instead of putting the full query from the challenge.
Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of our tool, some case studies in the com-
petition are analyzed, which help us to get the first rank in the 3rd preliminary
round, and some statistical results are shown.
The following sections provide the related work, tasks' information in the
competition, our tool architecture, along with experimental results. Our paper
will conclude with key findings and future research directions.

Related Work
In the recent LSC'23 competition, LifeXplore [6] won first place by leveraging
Open-CLIP (ViT-H/14) for powerful free-text search capabilities. Additionally,
two other strong systems, Momento 3.0 [9] and Voxento 4.0 [2], also used CLIP as
their primary method to tackle the challenge. Their approaches typically utilized
CLIP to establish semantic compatibility between text and images by mapping
both into a shared feature space for prediction. While this model achieved rela-
tively high performance, it still fell short of fully realizing its potential for precise
information retrieval. To maximize CLIP's capabilities and enhance its perfor-
mance, these teams often integrated it with search functions based on FAISS [5],
a technique that narrows the search space for feature vectors, especially for small
or hard-to-access images.
In recent research, querying images based on their content has emerged as a
popular approach. This method allows users to leverage key details in the image

context, such as street names, license plates, and so on. For this method to work
effectively, the images in the dataset need to be high resolution, and the fea-
ture matrices must be clearly defined. In the study [1], the authors propose an
OCR-based query method using Tesseract OCR and the Levenshtein algorithm.
Tesseract OCR is a robust tool with multilingual text recognition capabilities.
Meanwhile, the Levenshtein algorithm measures differences between character
strings, enabling accurate identification of key phrases even when the text con-
tains typos or variations, thereby improving query effectiveness and precision.
Another approach for image querying is based on video content, with an
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model playing a key role. ASR converts
video data into speech, extracting relevant phrases to create a text search tool
from voice data, optimizing language data, and supporting image querying. In
the LSC'23 competition, some systems used speech-to-text technology, such as
[8] with DeepSpeech. However, there has been limited discussion on systems that
retrieve images in videos based on voice, making our system a unique example.
Previous studies, like [7], have used the Speech API in their systems, but the
Whisper from OpenAI has yet to be widely adopted. Our team has chosen to
leverage the Whisper in our system to establish a new standard of accuracy and
efficiency in voice-based information retrieval.

Vietnam AI Challenge 2024
The Vietnam AI Challenge 2024, with the theme "Event Retrieval from Visual
Data", is organized to discover optimal, accurate, and fast solutions for querying
images based on queries provided by the competition organizers. For each round,
each team is given a large dataset consisting of videos covering diverse topics
and genres and video frames extracted by the organizers, setting the stage for
testing of retrieval systems. This competition serves as an ideal platform to refine
our expertise and contribute meaningful solutions to advancing the capabilities
of AI in multimodal understanding and visual retrieval, which holds immense
potential for applications in security, media, education, and beyond.
The competition itself involves three tasks that require retrieving video iden-
tifiers and frame indices as answers to query questions. For each task, the com-
petition ranks teams based on the accuracy first with the speed second. Task
descriptions and rules include:
- Text KIS7: The input is a natural language scene description, and the
expected output is a number representing the frame index that exists within
some specific video. This number must be within the required range (e.g.,
50000-60000).
- Video KIS: The organizer shows a specific segment of a video (as input)
and asks competitors to describe this segment as texts. The expected output
is the same as the output of Text KIS.

Fig. 1: Workflow for video content-based image retrieval: The system processes
video with shot detection, keyframe extraction, and embedding generation. It
combines text, audio, and image queries, using indexing to improve ranking, and
supports ASR, OCR, and image generation for better multimodal capabilities.
The diagram in Fig. 1 illustrates our tool architecture, which retrieves im-
ages from the dataset using various AI models, including CLIP, Whisper, and
PaddleOCR. The process is divided into two main parts: Data Preprocessing
and Retrieval Processing.
In the Data Preprocessing stage, the system extracts key images (keyframes)
from the video, ensuring that blurry or unclear frames are filtered out. Next, the
system employs the CLIP model to generate a digital representation (embed-
ding) of each image, capturing its semantic and visual information. For text ex-
traction, PaddleOCR is utilized to detect and store any textual content present
in the images. Simultaneously, the system processes the audio using Whisper,
which converts spoken language into text, enabling comprehensive multimodal
data analysis.
In the Retrieval Processing stage, users can search for images in different
ways: by typing in a query, speaking the query (speech is converted to text), or
even uploading an image. These query methods are classified into two groups:
Language (including texts and voices) and Image. For language queries, the
user should analyze the queries, and the system compares them with previously
processed data. The system uses several methods, such as audio, text, or text-
from-image (OCR) search. For image queries, the system can match the user's

image with similar images in the database using the CLIP model. There is also
an object outline feature, which uses DALL-E 3 to help retrieve relevant images.
To rank and sort the results, the system uses FAISS [10] to find the best
matches, then decides which images to show to the user. This makes it easier for
users to find the matching image based on their query.
4.1 Data preprocessing
Keyframe extraction: We utilize the Transnet V2 [15] model to analyze video
content and detect scene transitions effectively. This model computes the transi-
tion ratio at each frame in the video. If the calculated transition ratio exceeds a
predefined threshold, it is classified as a scene change. For every identified scene,
we strategically extract three keyframes: the first frame, the middle frame, and
the last frame of the scene.
The set of keyframes KF is given by:
KF = {KFfirst, KFmiddle, K Fast } = {S1, S|2 |, Sn-1}
(1)
- S be the set of frames in the identified scene.
- n be the total number of frames in the scene, where n = |S|.
- Si be the i-th frame in the scene.
By selecting only three frames to represent each scene, rather than capturing
every frame, we achieve a more efficient yet effective summarization. Focusing
on these specific frames enhances both the accuracy of content retrieval and the
quality of the video summary.
Remove blurry images: To effectively eliminate blurry images from a dataset,
we employ a technique that involves calculating the Laplacian variance [11] of
each image. When we compute the Laplacian of an image, we measure how
much the intensity of pixels changes across the image. A blurry image tends to
have a more uniform intensity distribution, resulting in a low variance value. This
technique removed a large amount of blurry images. Approximately 78,000 blurry
images, constituting 17.33% of the dataset, were detected using this method.
Remove redundant images: For further optimizing the dataset, we propose a
method using color histograms and edge detection with OpenCV. This approach
identifies and removes redundant frames based on predefined thresholds, com-
paring each frame against a set of classified redundant frames. Frames deemed
similar are excluded, eliminating about 30,000 redundant images (6.67% of the
dataset) and improving retrieval accuracy.
Indexing and name entity extraction: We extract the 768-dimensional em-
bedding of each frame using the CLIP ViT-L/14 model. This model has a larger
architecture and significantly more parameters compared to the CLIP ViT-B/32,
6
Tu et al.,
which was recommended by the competition organizers. The increased number
of parameters allows the CLIP ViT-L/14 model to capture more semantic fea-
tures. Afterward, all the vector embeddings are indexed using FAISS, which
builds an efficient vector database for the system. This database enables fast
and accurate retrieval of similar frames during the search process. In addition,
the PaddleOCR [13] and the Whisper model are integrated. PaddleOCR is used
to extract text directly from image frames, enabling rapid identification of char-
acters and words within the visual content. While that, the Whisper model
processes audio streams to transcribe spoken language from videos.
4.2 Voice-based and text-based retrieval:
In our tool, users can input queries in a natural language format, supporting both
Vietnamese and English. Additionally, the tool offers voice-based input, utilizing
the Whisper [4] to accurately convert spoken queries into text. After that, based
on the input query, GPT-4o will be used to extract information and generate an
enhanced query that better captures the user's intent and provides more relevant
results. This approach enables a convenient experience and improve accuracy
Sematic search: To implement the semantic search function, we leverage the
power of the CLIP [3] model, specifically the CLIP ViT-L/14 model, along with
FAISS [5]. This process is carried out step by step, as outlined below.
1. When a natural language query is provided, the CLIP model is used to
encode the query into a vector embedding.
2. Then FAISS compares the query embedding with the dataset's indexed em-
beddings by computing the similarity between the query vector and the
image vector using L2 distance.
3. Received an array of indexes sorted based on their similarity to the query.
4. Mapping the index back to the corresponding image
5. The result is a list of ranked images that have similar semantic features with
the query
Characters and named entity search: To match extracted text and audio
data with user queries, the Jaro-Winkler algorithm [12] is employed to calcu-
late the similarity between text strings. This algorithm is particularly effec-
tive for handling minor variations in spelling or pronunciation. By ranking text
based on similarity scores, the approach ensures that the most relevant result ap-
pears at the top of the list. The Jaro-Winkler algorithm assigns higher similarity
scores to strings that share a common prefix, making it well-suited for comparing
named entities or keywords. For example, it can effectively match variations like
"Jonathon" and "Jonathan" or "color" and "colour." To improve search precision,
a similarity threshold (e.g., 0.85) is applied. Only text with a similarity score
above this threshold is retained. This filtering process enhances the accuracy of
query results for both OCR and transcribed audio content, ensuring that only
closely matching entities are considered relevant.

Interactive system for visual data retrieval
4.3 Visual similarity search
As mentioned, some "noisy" images share similar characteristics with the target
image, making accurate identification challenging. To address this issue, we de-
signed a function called Image Retrieval (IR). This function re-ranks the set of
images previously ranked by other methods based on the image selected by the
user for verification. For example, the user selects an image i that they believe
is the correct match. The system then compares the embedding vector of the
selected image i with the dataset embeddings using FAISS, as described in the
Semantic Search section. After re-ranking, a new set of images with high sim-
ilarity to the selected one is generated, making it easier to review and confirm
the accuracy of the results.
4.4 Generative AI image-based query
During our recent competition, we encountered a critical obstacle: the video-
KIS queries involved a highly abstract concept that couldn't be processed using
standard tools. This query required a level of semantic understanding and visual
creativity that went beyond conventional information retrieval methods. Faced
with this limitation, we leveraged the DALL-E 3 model, known for its robust ca-
pability to generate images based on textual prompts. By converting our initial
prompt ideas into corresponding images, we created a visual representation that
facilitated further processing and comparison in our Image Retrieval (IR) func-
tion. These AI-generated images were transformed into vectors, enabling precise
matching with similar images in the system's database. Upon evaluation, this
approach demonstrates superior accuracy compared to the traditional method.
However, during further testing, it showed a longer response time. The above
strategy is shown in Alg. 1.
Algorithm 1 Generative AI image-based query

The interface of our tool (shown in Fig. 2) includes five sections:
- Section A (Toolbar Section): this section contains the text input field for
entering the query, along with options for selecting query modes.
- Section B allows users to adjust the number of images retrieved and includes
tools like a GPT-powered chatbox for query refinement and a QA module
for image-related answers.
- After the query process, section C displays the images ranked according to
relevance after a query is processed.
- Section D displays images that come before and after the selected image.
- Section E, this section of the system allows users to create new images based
on a prompt; such images are then used for querying similar images

Case studies
As discussed, the tool mainly helps users to address tasks mentioned in Sect. 3.
In addition to traditional semantic search methods that typically yield a ranked
list, there are certain cases where alternative methods achieve higher rankings.
In this section, we will provide three examples.
In the video-KIS format, queries often include specific named entities, such
as "SG93711TS" shown in Fig. 3, We use the OCR-based querying function to
retrieve images that contain this phrase. PaddleOCR detects and extracts the
code even if it is partially damaged or obscured, such as by chipped paint.

Additionally, in the Text-KIS task, to make it possible to return the best
candidates, our tool allows users to search for images based on text prompts.
For example, the input query "Three Olympic medals of Paris 2024" (shown in

The baseline model, CLIP ViT-B/32, introduced by the competition orga-
nizer and combined with traditional semantic search techniques, does not effec-
tively address the case studies outlined due to the absence of data and query
preprocessing.
5.2 Performance statistics
This section shows some statistical results refer to two contexts, where one (i)
is to use direct inputs from the competition and one (ii) is to use GPT-4o to
refine such inputs. We focus on the dataset with 65 questions from the prelim-
inary round and 15 questions from the final round, each having 4 hints. Tab. 1
shows the results of the 65 preliminary questions. based on the ranking range8
where "Unenhanced query" and "Enhanced queries" refer to the contexts (i) and
(ii), respectively. In context (i), most of the rankings fall within rank 1 to 5 or
above 50. However, in context (ii), the prevalence within ranks 1 to 10 increases
significantly and there is a notable reduction in rankings from 20 onward. It indi-
cates that using LLMs (such as GPT-4o) can reduce the noise from the original
queries.

Conclusion
In this paper, we presented an interactive video content retrieval system de-
signed to efficiently handle multimodal queries. By leveraging large models such
as CLIP [3], GPT-4o [14], Whisper [4], and PaddleOCR [13], our system pro-
vides robust search capabilities through features like semantic image search,
OCR-based queries, voice-based search, AI-powered query sketching, and query
standardization. The compact web interface ensures a seamless user experience,
making complex queries more accessible.
Despite these achievements, several areas for improvement remain. In future
work, we will focus on further optimizing query response times, ensuring mini-
mal latency during high-load scenarios. Fine-tuning models to handle ambiguous
and noisy inputs more effectively, especially with complex audio and reversed
text, will also be a priority. Moreover, we aim to enhance query standardization
techniques to improve consistency across diverse input formats. Lastly, expand-
ing the system's scalability through distributed cloud deployment is another
direction to accommodate even larger datasets and simultaneous queries.
